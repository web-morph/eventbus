/**
 * Marks a method as an event handler that should be invoked when an event of a compatible type is published.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is used to register methods for reactive, non-blocking event handling via the EventBus system.
 * Methods annotated with {@code @EventHandler} must have exactly one parameter, representing the type of event
 * to handle. The method may return {@code void}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Handlers can define their execution order using the {@link #priority()} attribute. Lower priorities
 * execute earlier, while higher priorities are delayed. This allows fine-grained control over
 * the order in which listeners react to the same event.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #force()} flag indicates whether this handler should be invoked even if the event has been
 * cancelled by a previous handler. This is useful for listeners that must observe or log cancelled events,
 * or for critical operations that must run regardless of cancellation state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @EventHandler(priority = EventPriority.HIGH, force = true)
 * public void onUserKicked(UserKickEvent event) {
 *     // Always handle, even if cancelled
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see EventBus
 * @see EventPriority
