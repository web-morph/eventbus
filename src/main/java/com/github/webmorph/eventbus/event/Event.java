/**
 * Base class for all events used in the reactive EventBus system.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as the foundation for both cancellable and non-cancellable event types.
 * It supports dynamic dispatching and static registration of handlers based on event type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each subclass of {@code Event} can be dispatched via {@link #dispatch()}, and can also
 * register listeners via static {@code on(...)} methods without requiring direct access to the {@link EventBus}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Listeners are automatically associated with the calling event class using internal stack inspection.
 * This eliminates boilerplate code such as explicitly passing the event class for subscription.</p>
