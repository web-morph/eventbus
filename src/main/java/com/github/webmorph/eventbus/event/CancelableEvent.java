/**
 * An abstract base class for events that can be conditionally cancelled by event handlers.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link Event} by introducing a {@code canceled} flag, which allows
 * listeners to interrupt or halt further processing of the event. It is commonly used
 * when an operation should be vetoable, such as auth, validation, or user-driven actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Event handlers can check the cancellation state using getter for {@link #canceled},
 * and may invoke setter for {@link #canceled} to modify it. By default, the event is not cancelled.</p>
 *
 * <p>When an event is cancelled, further non-{@code force=true} handlers are skipped during propagation.</p>
 *
 * @see Event
